# Git In Practice
Git In Practice is an intermediate-level Git book due to be published by Manning in 2014.

## Status
Git In Practice is a work in progress.

I rewrite the history of this repository often. Sorry about that.

## Usage
You can read all the AsciiDoc source files inline on GitHub.

If you want to create HTML, Manning XML or PDF files then clone this repository into the `./input/` subdirectory of a local [ManningAsciiDoc](https://github.com/mikemcquaid/ManningAsciiDoc) clone.

## Contributing
If you contribute changes to this repository you agree that I'll pretend I wrote them and may thank you in the foreword but you won't be assigned partial copyright or receive any royalties.

If you're OK with that then please feel free to create issues or pull-requests. Please don't edit the repository directly unless I've explicitly given you permission to do so.

Thanks!
