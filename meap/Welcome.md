Hi,

Thanks for purchasing the MEAP of Git In Practice. I hope that what you’ll get access to will be of immediate use to you and, with your help, the final book will be great!

Git is a powerful distributed version control system but it can sometimes be difficult to understand what is going on behind the scenes or how you’ve found yourself in a particular state. In Git In Practice by the end of the book you should understand:

- The internals and confusing jargon Git will sometimes expose
- A wide array of commands for interacting with Git repositories
- Workflows for configuring, using Git and GitHub effectively for teams, products and open-source project

What you’ll be getting immediately is Part 1 of the book with a chapter each from Parts 2 and 3.

Part 1 (Chapters 1-2) will fly through the basics of using Git while teaching you the underlying concepts that are often misunderstood or omitted in beginners guides. You may know how to use Git already but I’d encourage you to preserve with this anyway; it’s setting a good foundation which the rest of the book will build upon.

Chapter 3 (from Part 2) will show you various ways of interacting with the filesystem using Git in a problem/solution format.

Chapter 9 (from Part 3) discusses two approaches for team branch workflows using Git; rebasing and merging. These are compared by contrasting the approaches taken by two successful open-source projects: the CMake build system and the Homebrew OS X package manager.

Part 2 will continue to introduce more Git commands in a problem/solution format and Part 3 will introduce more high-level workflows for managing projects and teams when using Git.

Please let me know your thoughts on what’s been written so far and what you’d like to see in the rest of the book. Your feedback will be invaluable in improving Git In Practice.

Thanks again for your interest and for purchasing the MEAP!
