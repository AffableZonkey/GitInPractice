# Front Matter
## Reader Prerequisites
Not actually a real section (but could be).

- Unix (medium): familiarity with the Unix shell and interacting with the filesystem and various tools using it (Git will only be used as a command-line tool in this book). For example, needs to be able to create, edit and remove directories and files from the command-line. This includes Windows users who will be encouraged to install MSYSGit (which provides Git in a Unix shell on Windows).
- Version Control Systems (basic): previous experience with any version control system or is a quick learner who doesn't need to be walked through the very basic concepts in too much detail.
- Graphs (very basic): perhaps unimportant but will help with visualizing repository histories and branches.
- GitHub: access to a free GitHub account.

### Learning Outcomes
- How to create and interact with Git repositories, new or existing.
- When and why to create branches and how to merge between them.
- An efficient workflow for using Git as a programmer.
- How to submit good patches to open-source projects.
- How to automate interaction with Git wherever possible.
- How to configure Git to best suit individual workflows.
- How to revert to any previously committed state with Git (even when rewriting history).
- Understanding of how Git stores and manipulates data and advanced conceptual understanding of Git.
