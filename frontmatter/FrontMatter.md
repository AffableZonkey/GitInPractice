# Front Matter
## Reader Prerequisites
- Unix Shell (medium): familiarity with the Unix shell and interacting with the filesystem and various tools using it (Git will only be used as a command-line tool in this book). For example, needs to be able to create, edit and remove directories and files from the command-line. This includes Windows users who will be encouraged to install MSYSGit (which provides Git in a Unix shell on Windows).
- Software Development (medium): later chapters will require understanding of how version control is used in a team of software developers.
- Git/Version Control Systems (basic): previous working experience with any version control system (preferably distributed) or is a quick learner who doesn't need to be walked through the very basic concepts in too much detail.
- Graphs (very basic): perhaps unimportant but will help with visualizing repository histories and branches.
- GitHub (none): able to access to a free GitHub account.
- Programming Languages (none): no particular programming language knowledge.

## Target Readers
- "Software Engineer" who uses Git and knows enough interact with a Git repository but finds it a hinderance rather than a tool.
- "Undergraduate" who is familiar with version control concepts but not Git and wants to learn how to use it.
- "Software Engineer" with advanced Subversion knowledge who works on a project that is being moved to Git.
- "Software Engineer" who has never used Git before but is a quick learner and wants to skip (or Google) the basics.
- "Lead Software Engineer" who is designing a Git/GitHub process/best practices document for their team.
- "System Administrator" who knows how to use Git but wants to understand it a bit better and host Git-based utilities.
- "Software Engineer" with experience using Git but wants to create and/or contribute to open-source projects.
