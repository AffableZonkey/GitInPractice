== Advanced Branching
Merging between branches, handling conflicts and branching workflows.
Deals with all the non-history rewriting ways of bringing commits from
another branch into the current branch, interacting with branches and
destroying them.

Relies on Git branches concepts from previous chapter.

=== List what branches contain a commit

=== Create a tag

=== Describe the current state of a commit based on previous tags

=== Revert a previous commit

=== Add a single commit to the current branch

=== Add a single commit to the current branch with a sign-off

=== Merge two branches

=== Resolve a merge conflict

=== Merge two branches without a merge commit

=== Merge two branches and force a merge commit

=== Merge two branches with a different diff algorithm

=== Only resolve each merge conflict once

=== Pull a branch from a repository without merging

=== Delete a merged branch

=== Delete an un-merged branch
