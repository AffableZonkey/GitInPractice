# Introduction To Git

An introduction to version control as a concept and why it is considered good practice for programmers to use it. Explain what makes distributed version control different to centralized version control, the benefits of distribution and why Git is a good choice.

With the basic concepts explained provide a practical walkthrough to how to get Git installed on their machine and get some Git hosting on the internet. Suggest some large Git projects to examine if curious and to indicate that Git is widely used.

## Reader Prerequisites
Not actually a real section (but could be).

- Unix (medium): familiarity with the Unix shell and interacting with the filesystem and various tools using it (Git will only be used as a command-line tool in this book). For example, needs to be able to create, edit and remove directories and files from the command-line. This includes Windows users who will be encouraged to install MSYSGit (which provides Git in a Unix shell on Windows).
- Version Control Systems (basic): previous experience with any version control system or is a quick learner who doesn't need to be walked through the very basic concepts in too much detail.
- Graphs (very basic): perhaps unimportant but will help with visualizing repository histories and branches.
- GitHub: access to a free GitHub account.

### Learning Outcomes
- How to create and interact with Git repositories, new or existing.
- When and why to create branches and how to merge between them.
- An efficient workflow for using Git as a programmer.
- How to submit good patches to open-source projects.
- How to automate interaction with Git wherever possible.
- How to configure Git to best suit individual workflows.
- How to revert to any previously committed state with Git (even when rewriting history).
- Understanding of how Git stores and manipulates data and advanced conceptual understanding of Git.
