The goal of this book is similar to that of "JavaScript: The Good Parts"; rather than provide a complete technical manual of everything Git can do instead provide a detailed understanding to software developers in how to use the best parts of Git to provide and inform the best software engineering workflow.

Reader Prerequisites:

* Command Line (medium): familiarity with the command-line as Git will only be used as a command-line tool in this book. For example, needs to be able to create, edit and remove directories and files from the command-line. This includes Windows users who will be need to install MSYSGit (which provides Git in a Unix shell on Windows).
* Software Development (medium): this book will assume a basic understanding (and desire to learn more) about how version control is used in a team of software developers to build software projects.
* Git (basic) or Version Control (medium): understanding of versions, branching and merging in Git (e.g. `git commit`) or another version control system (e.g. Subversion `commit`, `log`, `copy`, `switch`, `merge`).
* GitHub (none): able to access to a free GitHub account.
* Programming Languages (none): no particular programming language knowledge.

Target Readers:

* "Software Developer" who uses Git and knows enough interact with a Git repository but lacks understanding of any features beyond those provided by other version control systems.
* "Software Developer" with advanced Subversion knowledge (i.e. happy with branching, merging, setting/getting Subversion metadata variables) who wishes to learn how to use Git.
* "Software Developer" who wishes to learn Git best practices to contribute to open-source projects on GitHub.
* "Trainer" with Git experience who wants to learn some more conceptual information, commands they may have missed, workflows and find a resource to help coach others on using Git.
* "System Administrator" with has good version control understanding but wants to create Git repositories for scripts and/or host repositories for teams.
