# Introduction to Git
The first part of this book will give you an outline of the essential concepts
required to understand how version control systems work and how to make Git
perform the basic tasks expected of a version control system.

I will start by explaining generic version control system concepts, how
distributed version control differs from centralized version control, creating
new versions in a version control system and finally how to share these changes
with others.
