= Introduction to Git
The first part of this book will give you an outline on the essential concepts
necessary to understand how version control systems work and how to make Git
perform the basic tasks that would be expected of a version control system.

I will start by explaining generic version control system concepts, explain how
distributed version control differs from centralized version control, move onto
creating new versions in a version control system and finally how to share
these changes with others.
